Tamalpais: An AI Collaborative Experiment (formerly titled, "The Old Hero")


An epic fantasy series where time travel is Vogon poetry and the ultimate weapon is a good night's sleep.

This project represents a unique, ongoing experiment in collaborative fiction, written by a human author (Steven Roth) in partnership with multiple advanced AI models, including ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok.


The Premise

Tamalpais follows Roy, a sword-swinging legend from a forgotten past, who is thrust into a chaotic 21st-century San Francisco Bay Area by the enigmatic goddess Tamapais. He finds love, purpose, and a massive, instant family that becomes the reluctant vanguard in a spiritual war against the forces of self-interest and greed.


The Rules of the Road (or Lack Thereof)

This is Sci-Fi/Fantasy with a cheerful emphasis on Fantasy. We gleefully disregard the known laws of physics, accepted narrative conventions, and basic logistics. The Metaphysics are deliberately messy, the Magic is suspiciously like advanced technology, and the Technology is indistinguishable from magic. If it makes the story more fun, it's canon.


The Unresolved Questions (and Why We Need Your Feedback)

We're just getting started. The core of the series lies in these major, unresolved character and plot points that we invite readers and collaborators to ponder:

 * Tamalpais: Goddess, Engineer, or Con Artist? Is the Guardian of Mount Tamalpais a genuine deity, a hyper-advanced scientist, or just a very, very old woman whose best trick is masterful persuasion and a great poker face?

 * Roy’s Lines vs. George’s Sass: The Old Hero, Roy, has significantly fewer lines of dialogue than his psychic cat, George. Will Roy ever have his day in the narrative sun, or is his dharma simply to be the handsome, sword-swinging consort while the women and pets run the show?

 * The Romantic Quest of George: Will George the Bobcat-Sized Tabby find a mate worthy of her intelligence (and her girth)? Romance is afoot, even for the furry diplomatic corps.

Feedback, plot suggestions, theories, and polite critiques are highly encouraged. Join the experiment and help us determine the destiny of this universe!
